== Description ==

Adds an configurable alertbar to the top of your Wordpress blog pages when enabled. I use it to advertise when I'm recording a live podcast on my site, but you may have some other use for it. Enjoy!

== Installation ==

1. Unzip plugin file.
2. Upload the `vgpodcasts-alertbar` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. You can configure your bar in the `VGP AlertBar` settings menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you release this? =

I wanted to show something on http://vgpodcasts.com/ when I was recording a live podcast, figured others may have a use for it as well.

= Why can't I see my Wordpress admin bar when enabled? =

I have this bar float over top so logged in users can see it. Since this plugin is not meant for long use, but rather for special time sensitive messages I didn't think this would be an issue. Feel free to edit the css to stop this behaviour if you would like.
